\usage{
BICw(BIC_results)
}
\arguments{
\item{BIC_results}{A numeric vector of BIC values.}
}
\value{
A list of length two. First element is a numeric vector with relative likelihoods and second element is a numeric vector with BIC weights. Vectors are of the same length as inputs, order is preserved.
