\title{Compare BIC weights for a set of models.}
\usage{
compare_BICw(BICweights, model_names = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{BICweights}{A numeric vector of BIC weigths.}

\item{model_names}{Optional character vector with names of the models.}
}
\value{
A data frame where each cell represents a likelihood of the model denoted by the row name with respect to the model denoted by the cell's column name. Order of the models from the input to the function is preserved.
}
\description{
With BIC weights instead of raw BIC values one can get the sense of magnitude how much more likely (in terms of Kullback-Leibler discrepancy) one model is than some other model that has also been fitted. To get such a likelihood we divide the BIC weight of one model with the BIC weight of the other fitted model. See Wagenmakers and Farrel (2004) for details.

# example from Wagenmakers and Farrel (2004) article
BIC <- c(204, 202, 206, 206, 214)
BICweights <- BICw(BIC)$BICweights
# comparing BIC weights
compare_BICw(BICweights)
