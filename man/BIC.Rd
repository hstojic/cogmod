\name{BIC}
\alias{BIC}
\title{Compute Bayesian information criterion of the model.}
\usage{
BIC(logLikelihood, noPar, noObs)
}
\arguments{
\item{logLikelihood}{Either a natural logarithm of the maximum likelihood of the model, or a vector of logged probabilities for each trial. Note that it should not be a negative of the log likelihood.}

\item{noPar}{Number of free parameters in the model.}

\item{noObs}{Number of observations used to obtain the maximum likelihood of the model.}
}
\value{
The BIC value of the model in a form of a scalar.
}
\description{
This is a standard implementation where log likelihood is multiplied by -2 and penalty term is added in the form of number of parameters times log of number of observations. See Schwarz (1978) for details.
}
\examples{
# 100 artificial trials with probability for each trial
set.seed(1234)
maxLikelihood <- runif(100)
# you can use either a final log of the maximum likelihood
logLikelihood1 <- sum(log(maxLikelihood))
# or logged probabilites of each trial
logLikelihood2 <- log(maxLikelihood)
# computing the BIC value, both give the same value
BIC(logLikelihood1, 3, 100)
BIC(logLikelihood2, 3, length(logLikelihood2))
