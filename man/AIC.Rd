\name{AIC}
\alias{AIC}
\title{Compute Akaike information criterion of the model.}
\usage{
AIC(logLikelihood, noPar, noObs = NA, correction = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{logLikelihood}{Either a log of the maximum likelihood of the model, or a vector of logged probabilities for each trial. Note that it should not be a negative of the log likelihood.}

\item{noPar}{Number of free parameters in the model.}

\item{correction}{TRUE if finite sample correction is needed, by default FALSE. Recommended to use if number of observations divided by number of free parameters is less than 40.}
}
\value{
The AIC value of the model in a form of a scalar.
}
\description{
This is a standard implementation where log likelihood is multiplied by -2 and penalty term is added in the form of 2 times the number of free parameters in the model. Optionally, finite sample correction can be used. See Burnham and Anderson (2002) for details.
}
\examples{
# 100 artificial trials with probability for each trial
set.seed(1234)
maxLikelihood <- runif(100)
# you can use either a final log of the maximum likelihood
logLikelihood1 <- sum(log(maxLikelihood))
# or logged probabilites of each trial
logLikelihood2 <- log(maxLikelihood)
# computing the AIC value, both give the same value
AIC(logLikelihood1, 3)
AIC(logLikelihood2, 3)
# if finite sample correction is used, then we need to supply number of observations as well
AIC(logLikelihood2, 3, length(logLikelihood2))
