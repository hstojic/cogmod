# cogmod

Collection of useful R functions for cognitive modeling. The reason for turning these functions into a package is that it improves reproducibility of data analysis and modeling in my scientific articles. Everyone is welcome to use them under the licence terms.

The package is at the moment rather poor, as it takes time to put the functions I regularly use in my reasearch in a nicer form and provide documentation. 

## Install

For now you can install the package from `github` using the `devtools` package. 

    ```R
    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("hstojic/cogmod")
    ```
